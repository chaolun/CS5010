;; Ex 1: Compute the number of seconds in a leap year (a leap year has 366 days)
(* 366 24 60 60)

;; Ex 2: write an expression that tests if the result of 100/3 is greater than the result of (100 + 3) / (3 + 3).

;; Ex 3: Write the definition of a function that converts a temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celcius. 
;; The formula for the conversion is C = (F-32) * (5/9) . 
;; The contract, purpose statement and examples for this function are:
;; contract: give number get number
;; purpose statement: give degrees in F and returns degrees in C
;; examples: (F2C 32) = 0
